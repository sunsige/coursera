# Learning Objectives

- Illustrate how changes in a system's trust boundaries and vulnerabilities affect its attack surface.
- Assess the impacts a particular vulnerability or attack may have on CIA properties (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) given a particular system scenario.
- Explain the role of logging and monitoring in cybersecurity
- Summarise the process for addressing security flaws found in software.
- Give examples of host-based security measures to ensure a systemâ€™s CIA properties (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).
- Show how host-based security measures can achieve separation of duty and least privilege.

# Overview

This course is the first in the University of Minnesota's 4-part Cloud Security specialisation.

We start the course with a deceptively simple and secure web service and we address the problems arising as we improve it. The improvements take us through a series of architectural steps. The improvements take us through a series of architectural steps. Each step makes strategic choices that both improve functionality and open security vulnerabilities. In response, each step introduces essential server security measures. 

As we work through these scenarios, we look at relevant security incidents, the vulnerabilities behind them, their impact on affected services, and how we assess the properties of vulnerabilities. Fortunately, there are lots of incidents to choose from.
