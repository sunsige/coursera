# VaR (Value at Risk)

## Definition

A measure of risk quantifying potential portfolio losses over a specific time horizon and probability.

## Example

A 1%, one-year VaR of $10 million means there is a 1% chance of losing $10 million in one year.

- Introduced after the 1987 stock market crash.
- Used for risk assessment in investments and portfolios.

# Stress Tests

## Definition

A method to assess risks to firms or portfolios during extreme financial crises.

## Origin

Initially a medical term for heart testing; adapted to finance in the 1960s.

## Application

- Conducted by regulators (e.g., Federal Reserve, European Banking Authority) to evaluate firm stability during crises.
- Introduced formally for financial regulation through the Dodd-Frank Act (2010) in the U.S., requiring annual tests with at least three economic scenarios.
- Scenarios may include severe recession, currency fluctuations, or liquidity crises.

## Challenges

- Difficulties in predicting the next crisis due to lack of imagination and understanding of extreme events (e.g., Anat Admati's criticism).
- Firms have incentives to whitewash public stress test results to protect reputations.
- Regulatory enforcement is complex, with pushback from firms.

## Historical Example

Pre-2008, stress tests by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight underestimated the risk of a >13% home price drop, leading to the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

# S&P 500

A stock price index that benchmarks returns of 500 large-cap U.S. stocks.

## Key Characteristics

- Reflects significant market volatility, showing dependence across stocks despite the Law of Large Numbers.
- Not used for forecasting but for analyzing historical risks using standard deviation.

## Apple Stock Analysis

Comparison with S&P 500:

- Apple stock exhibits higher variability than the S&P 500 index.
- Monthly return standard deviation: Apple (12.8%) > S&P 500.

Correlation with S&P 500:

- Positive correlation: Apple reacts in the same direction as S&P but with more volatility.
- Beta (1.45): Indicates Apple’s returns are 1.45 times more sensitive to market movements.
- Apple-specific "noise" factors (e.g., Steve Jobs' death) influence its variance.

| Topic | Key Concepts | Examples/Details |
| VaR | Quantifies risk with probability and time horizon | 1%, one-year VaR = $10M |
| Stress Tests | Assesses firm stability during crises; mandated by Dodd-Frank Act | Scenarios: recession, liquidity crisis, currency changes |
| Challenges | Predicting crises is difficult; firms may conceal results; regulators face enforcement hurdles | Example: Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac underestimated risk; Anat Admati’s criticism of current methods |

# Insurance Fundamentals

Insurance operates by pooling risks among policyholders, managed by an insurance company or government entity. Policyholders pay premiums to protect against specific, well-defined risks. The theory of insurance relies on **risk pooling**, grounded in the **Law of Large Numbers**, which predicts stable outcomes over many independent trials. For example, in life insurance, the formula for risk involves the standard deviation,  ​$\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$, where $p$ is the probability of a death. As the number of policies $n$ grows, uncertainty diminishes.

## Key challenges

- Moral Hazard: When insured individuals take more risks (e.g., careless behavior or deliberate actions to claim insurance).
- Selection Bias: When high-risk individuals disproportionately seek insurance, causing potential financial strain.

## Examples

- Crop Insurance: Susceptible to manipulation (e.g., false claims or negligence).
- Weather Insurance: An alternative approach, covering weather-related risks directly, bypasses some moral hazard issues but requires precise local measurements to work effectively.
- Insurance also addresses societal issues like flood risks by pricing them appropriately, discouraging risky behaviors like building in flood-prone areas. In contrast, philanthropic approaches may incentivize risky decisions, highlighting the importance of structured insurance systems.

# Insurance Milestones

## 1600s

The creation of actuarial life tables marked a breakthrough, enabling life insurance by quantifying mortality probabilities.

### Challenges in Adoption

Early mistrust of insurance persisted, even into modern times, as exemplified by uninsured families affected by disasters.

## Salesforce Model (1840)

Morris Robinson of Mutual Life of New York recognized the need for well-paid, community-trusted insurance salesmen to promote and maintain policies.

## Cash Value Insurance (1880s)

Henry Hyde introduced policies combining insurance with savings, creating incentives to retain coverage.

## Cultural Resistance

Sociologist Viviana Zelizer studied 19th-century objections to life insurance, particularly among women, who viewed it as gambling or unspiritual, rooted in religious faith and mistrust of financial schemes.

# Disasters

## Haitian Earthquake (2010)

- Despite efforts to promote catastrophe insurance in the Caribbean, most people in Haiti were not insured against the earthquake. The failure to insure was due to a combination of mistrust of institutions and perhaps a tendency to believe in good luck or the idea that such a disaster wouldn’t happen.

## Hurricane Katrina (2005)

- Even in the United States, where people are generally more attuned to financial risks, there were gaps in insurance coverage. Many people had wind insurance, but lacked flood insurance, which led to significant undercompensation for those affected by the storm. Additionally, some had canceled their insurance due to rising costs, and the mandatory National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 had limited success in getting people to buy flood insurance.

## Government Role in Insurance

- The government has stepped in to provide flood insurance in high-risk areas and offer loans to those who didn't have the right coverage. This system aims to create incentives to discourage building in flood-prone areas while providing minimal government assistance for people who fail to buy flood insurance.

## Terrorism Insurance

- The risk of terrorism was largely unconsidered in insurance policies until after the September 11 attacks. Insurers began excluding terrorism from their policies, which led to government intervention. The U.S. government created the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in 2002 to help cover the costs of terrorism insurance, with the government taking on most of the financial burden to avoid overwhelming the insurance industry.

## Temporary vs. Permanent Solutions

- The TRIA has been renewed several times but remains a temporary measure. The analogy with bankruptcy law suggests that, like bankruptcy laws eventually became permanent in response to frequent financial crises, terrorism risk insurance may eventually need to become a permanent part of the insurance landscape.

The underlying theme is the challenge of insuring against catastrophic, high-impact events that carry a high degree of uncertainty and potential for massive loss. Governments often end up stepping in to provide support when insurance markets fail to adequately address such risks, but this raises questions about the long-term sustainability and fairness of such solutions.

# Risk

The concept of risk management through diversification, rather than insurance, emphasises holding a variety of assets. This foundational idea, rooted in portfolio theory, assumes a blank slate for risks unrelated to investments. Since all investments inherently involve risk, managing it by diversifying across assets ensures better outcomes.

The key principle in portfolio theory is that individual asset performance matters less than the overall portfolio's return and risk (measured as mean and variance). Originating from Harry Markowitz's groundbreaking work in the 1950s, this mathematical model optimizes portfolio risk using variance and covariance between assets. Although elegant, the model has limitations, as real-world complexities often exceed theoretical assumptions.

Hedge funds, exclusive investment entities for accredited investors, engage in high-risk, sophisticated strategies. These funds often promise high rewards for managers who outperform, but critics argue the fees are unjustifiable, and recent years have seen diminished returns. While hedge funds historically influenced financial markets, they also carry systemic risk, contributing to mass financial crises.

Post-2008, macroprudential regulation has become vital, focusing on systemic risks and interconnectedness among institutions. Stress tests and advanced risk measures now evaluate how institutions fare during crises. Prior methods, like "Value at Risk," proved inadequate in predicting cascading failures during the crisis, leading to enhanced tools.

## Black Swans and Rare Events

Nassim Taleb's concept of "Black Swan" events critiques traditional risk models for overlooking rare, catastrophic occurrences. These improbable events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, underscore the limitations of current methodologies. To improve, models must incorporate tail risks and account for extreme scenarios, though doing so remains a complex challenge.

# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

CAPM is a model for optimal portfolio selection.
It assumes all investors will hold a diversified, optimal portfolio that balances risk and return.

Diversification Challenges:
Individual investors often struggle to diversify fully due to limitations like fractional shares and round lot requirements.
Investment funds (e.g., mutual funds) emerged to address these challenges by diversifying portfolios on behalf of investors.

Mutual Funds:
Gained prominence after the 1940s.
Pool resources to invest in diversified assets and distribute returns equitably among investors.

Diversification Scope:
True diversification should include stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and other asset classes.

Equity Premium Puzzle:
Historical data (e.g., Jeremy Siegel's study) shows a significant return difference between stocks and short-term government bonds (3.9% equity premium over 200 years).
This raises questions about why short-term bonds are still favored by some investors, highlighting potential biases (e.g., U.S. success as a selection bias).

Limitations of Historical Data:
Past performance is not always indicative of future results.
For instance, utility stocks were considered safe but were speculative during the electrification era in the 1920s.
The reliability of historical data depends on the stability and predictability of industries.

# Beta (β)

Definition:
Beta measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the overall market's returns.
It's derived from the slope of the regression line in a scatter plot of a stock's returns versus the market's returns.

Example:
If the market return increases by 10% and Apple’s return increases by 15%, Apple’s beta is 1.5 (indicating higher sensitivity to market changes).
A beta of 1.0 implies the stock moves in line with the market, while >1.0 suggests higher volatility and <1.0 indicates lower volatility.

## Idiosyncratic Risk

Differences between actual stock performance and the regression line are due to company-specific factors (e.g., Apple-specific risks like leadership changes).
CAPM posits that investors prioritize market risk (beta) over idiosyncratic risk since diversification minimizes the latter.
